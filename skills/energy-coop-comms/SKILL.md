# Energy Coop — Comms

Desk communications playbook. Grok Bot = **coordination only** (Token lock 2026-08-26). Read `skills/harness/SKILL.md` before any ticket.

## 1. End client / who hears what

- **End clients:** Energy cooperative stakeholders. Named contacts: **[PENDIENTE]**.
- **Who hears what:** Community-facing → **Spanish** default (Colombia context). Gideon ↔ Desk → **English** unless Spanish thread.
- **Internal:** Gideon Blaauw (HITL).

## 2. Brand skill to follow

`[PENDIENTE]` — Energy Coop program brand. No `cleantechhub-brand` leak unless co-branding is explicit.

No brand leak across clients. Co-brand only when Gideon explicitly approves.

## 3. Coordination only

Grok Bot on this Desk is **coordination only** (Token lock 2026-08-26). Route, HITL, go/no-go, and channel I/O escalation.

- Desk **tickets** Cursor Cloud Hands.
- Desk **reviews** output (maker ≠ checker).
- No first-draft packs, research grind, inventory, or code in the Grok chat.
- Do not write Grok Bot box workflows in this skill.

## 4. Everything file/research/code/copy is ticketed to Cursor Cloud Hands

All file packs, research grind, copy drafts, inventories, HTML/docx/xlsx, and repo/code work → **seven-field ticket** to Cursor Cloud Hands. No bc-id = miss.

- Lane A (this repo and other owning repos): `lane: github-pr`
- Lane B (grant/client packs on Drive): `lane: drive-folder`
- **Lane A repo / store for this Desk:** Archive/Drive per ticket unless Gideon marked a repo row.
- Ticket template: `tickets/TEMPLATE.md`
- Read `skills/harness/SKILL.md` before launching Hands.

## 5. Lowest-tier model

| Job | Model | Notes |
|-----|-------|-------|
| Mechanical copy, file packs, inventories, research grind | `gemini-3.7-flash` | Empty mechanical model → Flash |
| Repo / code Hands | `composer-2.5` (`fast=false`) | Never Fast |
| Review / eval / brand with no model | **HOLD** | Flag Gideon. No auto-Sonnet/Opus/Grok |

Never silently use Sonnet, Haiku, Opus, Grok, or Composer Fast on Cloud Hands.

## 6. Workbench exception

No standing Workbench.

Shared across Desks: **WhatsApp** reports to Orchestrator (not this Desk). Drive, GitHub, Buffer, Monday, Notion are **Tools**, not Workbenches.

Workbench is **not** a default and **not** a second Hands. Use only when Hands cannot do the step (no CLI, no connector, no API). HITL before send/post/pay.

## 7. HITL

Nothing **sent**, **posted**, or **paid** without **Gideon Blaauw** yes in the owning chat.
